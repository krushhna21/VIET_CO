To create a fully functioning website for the Vishweshwarayya Institute of Engineering and Technology (Computer Department) with the latest features, here's a structured plan for both the frontend and backend using Prisma (for ORM) and MySQL (for database). I will also include design considerations, such as the 4K visual appeal, modern UX/UI, and user-friendly admin panel.

1. Frontend Structure

The frontend will be structured to offer an engaging and modern user experience with high-definition visuals and interactive features. Here's the basic structure:

Pages/Sections

3. Design and User Interface

UI/UX Design:

4K Visuals: Full-screen background images or videos on the homepage and key sections to give the site a modern, dynamic feel.

Color Scheme: Professional colors (blue, white, gray with accents of gold/black) to reflect the academic atmosphere.

Typography: Use Google Fonts like "Roboto", "Poppins", and "Lora" for readability and modern aesthetic.

Responsive Design: Mobile-first design, ensuring the website works seamlessly on any device (desktops, tablets, phones).

Interactive Elements: Smooth scrolling, hover effects, sliders, and carousels for events and media.

Animations: Subtle animations for page transitions and section reveals to make the site feel polished.

Accessibility:

Ensure contrast ratios are good for visibility

Implement keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

Optimized for Performance:

Lazy loading for images and videos

Compression of media files for faster load times

Caching strategies for better performance

4. Local Development Setup

Step 1: Initialize the project

Use Next.js for the frontend (React-based)

Express.js server for backend logic

Install Prisma ORM and configure it with MySQL

Step 2: Database Setup

Install MySQL locally

Set up the schema using Prisma and migrate your database

Use environment variables for sensitive information like database credentials

Step 3: Admin Panel

Use React components to create a simple and functional admin panel

Use JWT for secure login sessions
